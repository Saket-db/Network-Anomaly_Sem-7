# Ignore generated CSV outputs in data/ (and subfolders)
# (Keeps the data/ folder but ignores CSV files that are generated at runtime.)
/data/*.csv
/data/**/*.csv

# If you absolutely need to keep one example CSV in the repo, whitelist it:
# !/data/keep_this.csv
!/.gitkeep

# (Remove any global CSV ignore if you intentionally track some CSVs outside data/)
# Don't ignore all CSVs globally — keep control under /data/.
# *.csv

# Common ignores
